Free and fair elections are a central feature of democracy. As the world becomes more digital and mobile phones more widespread, online voting and blockchain technology have the potential to make voting more accessible and improve election integrity.

# PROBLEM IN CURRENT VOTING SYSTEM
Government elections around the world are facing increasing security threats and concerns over election integrity.India is the largest democracy in the world where the government is chosen by the people, of the people and for the people. But off late, with the electronic voting machines (EVMs) scam gaining pace, there have been doubts whether this is really happening or the ones in the power are making a mockery out of the country and its citizens.

Although the EVM hackathon organised by the Election Commission of India (ECI) earlier this month might have proven to be a dud, but it did give the common people an excuse to cough up some attention on what can be considered as the biggest problem in a democracy, provided if it does exist.

There are several studies in public domain today that allege that EVMs hardware and software can be tampered with to practice election malpractices. Although the ECI has maintained that such a thing is not possible in the EVMs that they have been using.

For the unversed, a blockchain is basically an anonymous online ledger that makes use of a data structure to make the process of transaction an easier and simpler process. It provides users the ability to manipulate the ledger in a safe way without seeking the support of a third party. While a bank’s ledger has connections to a centralised network, a blockchain is anonymous as it helps in protecting the identities of the users. This is what makes the technology of blockchain a safer way to carry out transactions than any other existing processes. Blockchain’s algorithm reduces the dependence on people to verify the transactions. This technology, which is currently being used for recording various transactions, has the true potential of completely disrupting the financial system in the near future.

# SOLUTION - BLOCKCHAIN
Online voting built on top of blockchain technology is very appealing because of the accessibility and the integrity that it can bring to elections. Blockchain’s fundamental characteristics — immutability, accountability and security — drive the technology’s potential for securely maintaining voter registration records and recording votes. In such a system, voting data is inputted into blocks that are timestamped, encrypted, and “locked” to prevent tampering and unauthorised viewing. The use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) means information is not centralised, ensuring all data is copied on nodes across the network. Information cannot be lost, and there are no central points for cyberattacks such as database deletion or denial of service attacks. The underlying peer-to-peer network provides a validation mechanism that protects the integrity of the data being locked into each block. To prevent voter fraud, a voting application may employ several identification and authentication methods before votes are cast. This digitisation of voter registration and voting processes has also been proven to make elections cheaper and easier to run.
